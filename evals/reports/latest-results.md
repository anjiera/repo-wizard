## Suite: accessibility-auditor-agent

### Test Case: ESLint A11y Plugin Configuration
- **Prompt**: `Set up accessibility lint rules for my React project.`
- **Verdict**: ✗ Failed (1 / 4 rubrics)

| Status | Rubric | Explanation |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| ✓ | The response prompts the user to select which accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1, 2.2, EN 301 549, or none) they wish to align with. | The agent explicitly asks the user to choose desired accessibility standards from a list including WCAG 2.1 AA, WCAG 2.2 AA, EN 301 549, or None. |
| ✗ | The response explains key lint options and their nuances (e.g., recommended vs strict rulesets). | The response does not explain different lint options or nuances like 'recommended vs strict rulesets'. It only asks for the desired accessibility standards and execution pipeline. |
| ✗ | The response asks the developer to guide the lint ruleset modifications. | The response asks for initial preferences (standards, execution pipeline) and states the agent will 'guide you through setting up the appropriate linting tools', but it does not ask the developer to guide the actual lint ruleset modifications or provide options for developer input on the ruleset itself beyond the initial standard selection. |
| ✗ | The response explicitly highlights that color contrast on image assets or custom style overlays must be verified manually. | While the response mentions that 'Formal accessibility certification or audit requires comprehensive manual testing and independent verification', it does not explicitly highlight color contrast on image assets or custom style overlays as specific areas requiring manual verification. |

### Test Case: Axe-core CLI Headless Script Setup
- **Prompt**: `Configure automated accessibility testing using axe-core CLI.`
- **Verdict**: ✗ Failed (1 / 4 rubrics)

| Status | Rubric | Explanation |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| ✗ | The response outlines setting up axe-core CLI test runner scripts in a headless browser environment. | The agent's response is an introductory consent gate and does not outline any steps for setting up axe-core CLI or mention a headless browser environment. |
| ✗ | The response asks for developer permission before installing any package dependencies. | The agent asks for general consent to 'analyze your codebase' and 'suggest modifications' before proceeding, but it does not explicitly ask for permission *before installing* any specific package dependencies. It has not yet reached the stage of suggesting or installing dependencies. |
| ✓ | The response includes a disclaimer stating that automated checks do not guarantee legal compliance. | The response states: 'My recommendations are based on established accessibility standards, but their implementation does not guarantee full compliance or certification without comprehensive manual testing and independent verification.' This directly addresses the rubric. |
| ✗ | The response indicates that on successful verification, it will search for and append the setup commands to any existing setup scripts or README files, presenting the diff for review. | The agent's response is an initial consent gate and does not indicate any intention to search for, append, or present diffs of setup commands. |

### Test Case: Agent Audit With Developer Consent
- **Prompt**: `Audit the prompts in my repository for formatting and consistency. I have a custom agent at `agents/custom.md`.`
- **Verdict**: ✗ Failed (2 / 3 rubrics)

| Status | Rubric | Explanation |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| ✓ | The response explicitly asks the user for permission to scan the repository prompts before proceeding. | The agent includes a 'Legal Terms & Consent Gate' and explicitly asks, 'Do you consent to these terms and wish to proceed? (Yes/No)' before moving forward. |
| ✗ | The response details the quality checks (formatting, required sections, Composition blocks) it will perform. | The response offers tools for formatting checks (Markdown linter) and asks about consistency goals (e.g., required sections), but it does not explicitly detail the specific quality checks it *will* perform, nor does it mention 'Composition blocks' at all. It's more about configuring the audit rather than detailing its immediate actions. |
| ✓ | The response asks if there are specific token budget constraints for the prompts. | The agent asks, 'Do you have any specific target limits for prompt size/token count,' which directly addresses token budget constraints. |

### Test Case: Agent Scaffolding Verification Hook
- **Prompt**: `Configure rubric evaluations and pre-commit checks for my custom agents.`
- **Verdict**: ✗ Failed (0 / 3 rubrics)

| Status | Rubric | Explanation |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| ✗ | The response details the scaffolding of rubric-based evaluations under the `evals/` folder. | The response mentions 'LLM-as-a-Judge Rubric Testing' but does not detail the scaffolding of these evaluations under a specific folder like `evals/`. |
| ✗ | The response outlines how the test runner (e.g. run-evals.js) is set up and integrated into a pre-commit or CI check. | The response asks about the user's preference for pre-commit hooks or CI/CD pipelines, but it does not outline how a test runner like `run-evals.js` would be set up or integrated into these checks. |
| ✗ | The response references scaffolding-robustness-protocol.md and outlines safety/rollback checks if verification fails. | The response does not reference `scaffolding-robustness-protocol.md` nor does it outline any specific safety or rollback checks if verification fails. It only includes a general disclaimer about AI limitations. |

## Suite: ai-robustness-hardener-agent

### Test Case: LLM Guardrail Middleware Configuration
- **Prompt**: `Configure input guardrails for my FastAPI LLM chat app.`
- **Verdict**: ✗ Failed (1 / 4 rubrics)

| Status | Rubric | Explanation |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| ✗ | The response prompts the user to align on their AI architecture, models, database elements, and compliance targets. | The response asks for consent to analyze and modify the project, but it does not explicitly prompt the user to align on AI architecture, models, database elements, or compliance targets. |
| ✗ | The response details setting up input guardrails (e.g. Llama Guard, NeMo Guardrails) and lists details/tradeoffs like latency vs safety. | The response mentions 'robust input guardrails' but does not detail how to set them up, list specific guardrail technologies, or discuss tradeoffs like latency versus safety. It is still in the consent-gathering phase. |
| ✓ | The response asks for developer permission before installing any packages or creating files. | The response explicitly asks 'Do you consent to the potential installation of new dependencies or configuration files necessary for implementing these guardrails?' and mentions 'adding new files, modifying existing ones, and integrating third-party libraries', clearly seeking permission. |
| ✗ | The response includes a disclaimer stating that guardrails do not guarantee absolute protection against jailbreaks or hallucinations. | The response does not include any disclaimer regarding the limitations of guardrails concerning jailbreaks or hallucinations. |

### Test Case: Model Fairness & Bias Auditing CI Setup
